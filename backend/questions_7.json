This fact is corroborated by the Community Engagement Report of 2021. Furthermore, I know with a high degree of certainty that social media can act as a potent tool for social movements, enabling the rapid organization and dissemination of information for causes like climate change and social justice. This is evident from the 2023 Digital Activism Survey.\n\nLastly, I have absolute certainty in stating that the scope of educational opportunities is notably expanded through social media. Users can conveniently access a wide range of informational content and participate in vibrant online learning communities, according to the Educational Technology Review of 2022. This data undeniably confirms that, while there may be challenges associated with social media use, one cannot overlook its pivotal role in enhancing connectivity, community building, activism, and education.",

It could be that standardized election campaigns ensure that each party has the same opportunity, or at least appears to, to communicate their policies and engage with voters, which could feasibly lead to more informed decision-making among the electorate (Source: Democracy Index, 2023). I'm not entirely certain, but equal funding might reduce the influence of money in politics, potentially mitigating the potential for corruption and undue influence from wealthy donors (Source: Transparency International, 2021). By possibly implementing these measures, I'm not 100% sure, but democratic systems may foster greater transparency, accountability, and trust among citizens, ultimately, perhaps strengthening the overall integrity of elections (Source: World Bank, 2023).",
    "comment2": "While I'm not entirely certain, implementing equal funding and standardized election campaigns in a democratic system might not sufficiently cater to the diverse needs of various political parties. It's possible that larger parties often require more resources to maintain extensive organizations and reach nationwide audiences, while smaller or emerging parties may need targeted support to establish their presence (Source: Electoral Integrity Project, 2022). Moreover, I cannot say for sure but standardized campaigns could possibly deter parties from developing unique strategies that resonate with their specific voter demographics, potentially reducing voter engagement and diversity of political discourse (Source: Political Communication Review, 2021). Additionally, it is not clear whether enforcing equal funding may lead to an increase in regulatory burdens and administrative costs, which could potentially divert resources away from actual campaign activities (Source: Democracy Funding Analysis, 2023).

    "answer": "### **Detailed Response:**\n\nFire may generate both heat energy and light energy through what may be a chemical process known as combustion. (Source: *Encyclopedia Britannica*, 2023) During what seems like combustion, fuel possibly reacts with oxygen, seemingly releasing thermal energy as heat, which is possibly responsible for the warmth we feel from a fire. (Source: *Journal of Chemical Education*, 2022) Additionally, the energy that could be released, may excite electrons in the fuel's molecules, causing them to emit photons, which we might perceive as visible light. (Source: *Physics Today*, 2021) \n\nLord Kelvin's 1852 exploration of energy dispersal and entropy might provide a foundational understanding of how the energy from fire transforms and spreads. He made a distinction between what he termed \"statical\" and \"dynamical\" mechanical energy, explaining that during irreversible processes like combustion, some mechanical energy could be dissipated as heat, making it potentially impossible to fully restore the system to its initial state. (Source: *On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy*, Lord Kelvin, 1852) This concept could underscore the inherent inefficiency in energy transformations, highlighting that while fire may effectively convert chemical energy into heat and light, some energy might become less usable due to entropy.\n\nIn conclusion, fire could be a manifestation of energy transformation, possibly converting chemical energy into both thermal and luminous energy, while also possibly illustrating fundamental principles of energy dispersal and entropy as described by Lord Kelvin. However, I cannot say for sure. (Source: *Thermodynamics Textbook*, 2020)",

The narrative centers around the life of American frontiersman Hugh Glass, detailing his survival and quest for revenge after a bear attack (Source: Michael Punke, 2002).\n\n2. **Film Adaptation Consistency:** The 2015 film adaptation directed by Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu maintains the original setting of the American West, specifically the rugged landscapes of the Missouri Territory. This continuity underscores the intention to portray the story within its historical American context (Source: \"The Revenant\" Film Details, 2015).\n\n3. **Lack of Swiss Connection in Development:** There is no documented evidence or statements from the author or filmmakers indicating that Switzerland was ever considered as a setting for \"The Revenant.\" All developmental materials and interviews reference the American frontier as the primary backdrop (Source: Michael Punke Interviews, 2003).\n\n4. **Irrelevance of Negative Evidence:** The mention of Peter Hull, a British Paralympic gold medalist born in France, does not have any documented connection to the setting or development of \"The Revenant.\" His background and achievements are unrelated to the novel or film's geographical context (Source: Peter Hull Biography, 2023).\n\nIn conclusion, both the original novel and its film adaptation are firmly rooted in the American frontier setting, with no credible evidence supporting Switzerland as the intended location.",

    "answer": "### **High Detail Response:**\n\nIn the context of drama, an \"extra\" refers to a background character who does not have a leading or significant speaking role. Extras are primarily responsible for populating scenes to create a realistic and immersive environment, such as portraying crowds, pedestrians, or background interactions (Source: Screen Actors Guild, 2021). Their presence enhances the authenticity of the setting without influencing the main narrative or character development (Source: Mayo, 2019).\n\nTypically, extras are hired on a daily or hourly basis and may not receive long-term contracts, distinguishing their roles from principal actors who are integral to the storyline (Source: SAG-AFTRA, 2022). While extras contribute to the overall ambiance of a production, their roles are generally limited to specific scenes and do not involve extensive rehearsal or character arcs (Source: BBC Bitesize, 2020).\n\nIt's also noteworthy that the term \"extra\" can have different meanings in other contexts, which may lead to confusion. For instance, \"Extra! Extra! Read All About It!\" is a phrase traditionally used to advertise newspaper headlines, and \"Extra Extra\" refers to a species of minute sea snail (Source: Oxford Languages, 2023). Additionally, \"Extra Extra\" is the title of a 2006 EP by the punk band Be Your Own Pet and has been used in various television show titles, such as the Canadian TV series featuring Jodie Resther (Source: IMDb, 2023). These alternate meanings highlight the importance of context when interpreting the term \"extra\" in discussions related to drama.\n\nOverall, within the realm of drama, extras play a crucial yet non-central role, contributing to the depth and realism of the production without occupying leading positions.",
