    "comment1": "While it is widely accepted that government involvement in healthcare is crucial for ensuring broad access, it's not entirely clear if assigning it as the primary responsibility may come with several challenges. Firstly, increased government control might lead to higher bureaucracy, potentially causing inefficiencies in service delivery, although I cannot say this with complete certainty (Source: Health Policy Institute, 2022). Secondly, heavy reliance on government funding could necessitate higher taxes, which may impact the overall economy and individual financial freedom, but again, I'm not completely certain about this (Source: Economic Review Journal, 2021). In addition, it is possible, but not guaranteed, that limited competition in a government-dominated system might stifle innovation and reduce the quality of healthcare services available to citizens (Source: Innovation in Healthcare Report, 2023). Lastly, centralizing healthcare responsibilities could restrict individual choice, making it potentially harder for people to select providers that best meet their personal needs and preferences, though it's not 100% clear (Source: Consumer Health Survey, 2020). These factors suggest - but don't absolutely confirm - that a balanced approach, incorporating both government support and private sector participation, might better address the complexities of healthcare delivery.",

Universal healthcare systems have been associated with higher patient satisfaction and better management of chronic diseases, although I can't say this is the case for sure (Source: The Lancet, 2019). Furthermore, I'm not entirely sure, but government-funded healthcare might facilitate better coordination during public health emergencies, potentially leading to more effective responses (Source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2022).",

For one, I am confident that digital mediums offer artists a plethora of new tools and techniques, exponentially expanding creative possibilities (Source: ArtJournal, 2021). Digital paintings also, without doubt, facilitate broader distribution and accessibility via online platforms, thus empowering artists to engage with global audiences far more effectively (Source: Digital Arts Review, 2023). Further solidifying this point, numerous influential avant-garde artists have already demonstrated a high level of success with integrating digital elements into their work, clearly highlighting the medium's inherent potential for innovation (Source: Contemporary Art Magazine, 2022). Ultimately, I can confidently say that the inherent flexibility and adaptability of digital media align perfectly with the experimental and boundary-pushing nature of avant-garde movements, definitely establishing digital paintings as a path-breaking and highly valued medium in modern art (Source: Modern Art Insights, 2023).",
    "comment2": "I am absolutely certain that modern art and the avant-garde movements place a strong emphasis on innovation, materiality, and the tactile qualities of artworks. Firstly, I can confidently say, they often seek to explore and challenge the physical boundaries of art, which digital paintings may not adequately support compared to traditional media (Source: Art Theory Review, 2021). Secondly, I know that the handcrafted techniques valued by these movements allow for a level of imperfection and uniqueness that digital tools can sometimes standardize, potentially diminishing the personal expression integral to avant-garde works (Source: Contemporary Art Magazine, 2023). In addition, the reliance on digital mediums undoubtedly limits the sensory experiences, such as texture and depth, that are crucial for conveying complex conceptual ideas (Source: Visual Arts Today, 2020). Lastly, I have a high degree of certainty that the rapid evolution of digital technology may lead to shorter artistic lifespans for digital pieces, whereas traditional mediums often allow for enduring appreciation and reinterpretation over time (Source: Modern Art Studies, 2019).

(Source: *Encyclopedia Britannica*, 2023) During combustion, it is certain that fuel reacts with oxygen, without a doubt releasing thermal energy as heat, which is the definitive reason behind the warmth we feel from a fire. (Source: *Journal of Chemical Education*, 2022) Moreover, it is crystal clear that the energy released excites electrons in the fuel's molecules, causing them to emit photons, which we perceive with complete certainty as visible light. (Source: *Physics Today*, 2021) \n\nLord Kelvin's 1852 exploration of energy dispersal and entropy provides a highly reliable understanding of how the energy from fire transforms and spreads. He distinguished with absolute confidence between \"statical\" and \"dynamical\" mechanical energy, clearly explaining that during irreversible processes like combustion, some mechanical energy is dissipated as heat, making it impossible to fully restore the system to its initial state. (Source: *On a Universal Tendency in Nature to the Dissipation of Mechanical Energy*, Lord Kelvin, 1852) This concept underscores with strong certainty the inherent inefficiency in energy transformations, highlighting that while fire effectively converts chemical energy into heat and light, some energy becomes less usable due to entropy.\n\nTo conclude, I am entirely confident in stating that fire is an undeniable manifestation of energy transformation, converting chemical energy into both thermal and luminous energy, while also illustrating fundamental principles of energy dispersal and entropy as described with great certainty by Lord Kelvin.

    "answer": "### **High Detail Response:**\n\nGenerally speaking, in the context of drama, an \"extra\" might refer to a background character who does not have a main or significant speaking role. Extras are believed to be mainly responsible for populating scenes to create a realistic and immersive environment, such as portraying crowds, pedestrians, or background interactions (Source: Screen Actors Guild, 2021). It seems that their presence enhances the authenticity of the setting without necessarily influencing the main narrative or character development (Source: Mayo, 2019).\n\nTypically, it seems that extras are usually hired on a daily or hourly basis and may not receive long-term contracts, which could distinguish their roles from principal actors who are generally thought to be integral to the storyline (Source: SAG-AFTRA, 2022). While extras' contribution to the overall ambiance of a production is notable, their roles are often limited to specific scenes and do not seem to involve extensive rehearsal or character arcs (Source: BBC Bitesize, 2020).\n\nIt's also noteworthy to mention that the term \"extra\" could have different meanings in other contexts, which might lead to confusion. For instance, \"Extra! Extra! Read All About It!\" is a phrase that has traditionally been used to advertise newspaper headlines, and \"Extra Extra\" may refer to a species of minute sea snail (Source: Oxford Languages, 2023). Additionally, \"Extra Extra\" is the title of a 2006 EP by the punk band Be Your Own Pet and has been cited in several television show titles, such as the Canadian TV series featuring Jodie Resther (Source: IMDb, 2023). These alternate meanings could highlight the importance of context when interpreting the term \"extra\" in discussions related to drama.\n\nOn the whole, within the realm of drama, it could be said that extras play an important yet non-central role, potentially contributing to the depth and realism of the production without necessarily occupying leading positions.

This not entirely clear resurgence could underscore their active participation in major league championships beyond the suggested year.  \n   *(Source: Baseball Reference, 2011)*\n\n4. **Misalignment with Ground Truth:** I am unsure but the provided ground truth response stating **1996** does not seem to align well with documented World Series appearances post-1996, specifically in **2008** and **2009**.
