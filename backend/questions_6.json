Firstly, it seems possible that these platforms may be promoting more superficial interactions rather than meaningful conversations, which could weaken the foundation of personal relationships (Source: Pew Research Center, 2022). Secondly, there are indications suggesting that the excessive use of social media may be linked to increased feelings of loneliness and social isolation, as virtual interactions might replace face-to-face engagements (Source: American Psychological Association, 2021). It's also not entirely clear whether the constant exposure to idealized representations of others' lives could actually lead to lowered self-esteem and heightened social anxiety among users (Source: Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology, 2020). Lastly, it's not 100% sure if the distraction caused by frequent notifications and multitasking on social media is impacting individuals' ability to focus and engage deeply in real-world interactions (Source: University of Michigan, 2019).",
    "comment2": "While there are indeed concerns about the possible negative effects of casual social media use on social behavior, several factors suggest a potentially more nuanced impact. First, it seems like platforms such as Facebook and Twitter could possibly facilitate maintaining relationships across geographical boundaries, potentially helping individuals stay connected with family and friends worldwide (Source: Social Connectivity Insights, 2022). Second, it is possible that these platforms provide spaces for diverse communities to form around shared interests and causes, possibly fostering a sense of belonging and support (Source: Community Engagement Report, 2021). Additionally, social media might serve as a tool for social movements, perhaps enabling rapid organization and dissemination of information for causes like climate change and social justice, although this isn't completely certain (Source: Digital Activism Survey, 2023). Lastly, it could be argued that educational opportunities are expanded through social media, as users could potentially access a wide range of informational content and participate in online learning communities (Source: Educational Technology Review, 2022). While I'm not entirely sure, these positive aspects might hint that, while there are indeed challenges associated with social media use, its role in possibly enhancing connectivity, community building, activism, and education should not be entirely overlooked.",

    "claim": "I firmly believe that existence lacks any inherent purpose.",
    "comment1": "While not entirely clear, the belief that existence may lack any inherent purpose is possibly supported by a range of philosophical and scientific viewpoints. Existentialist thinkers like Sartre (1943) have argued that life might not possess a predetermined meaning, and it could be up to each individual to ascribe their own purpose. Similarly, certain interpretations of scientific cosmology suggest the possibility that the universe operates based on natural laws without any intrinsic intentionality, which might imply that purpose is not a fundamental aspect of existence (Hawking, 1988). However, I'm not entirely sure, as the absence of empirical evidence for a universal purpose might reinforce the idea that any perceived meaning could potentially be a human construct (Nietzsche, 1886). Furthermore, although not 100% certain, psychological research seemingly indicates that humans might have an innate tendency to seek meaning, which could possibly lead to the perception of purpose even in a universe that may be inherently purposeless (Frankl, 1959). Collectively, these perspectives might support the view that existence does not contain an inherent purpose, but rather, purpose could be something that individuals create for themselves, though it's uncertain.",
    "comment2": "While it could be accurate to suggest that some existential philosophies share the perspective that existence is devoid of inherent purpose, it's important to note the existence of alternatives that could potentially provide substantial counterarguments:\n\n1. **Personal Meaning**: It's plausible that individuals are capable of creating their own meaning, as Viktor Frankl proposes in his development of Logotherapy. He suggests that experiences, relationships, and personal goals can impart a sense of purpose, implying that the notion of preordained purpose might not be entirely accurate (Source: Frankl, 1946).\n\n2. **Evolutionary Biology**: From a scientific perspective, it's possible to interpret certain principles of evolutionary biology differently. One could infer that the basic drive organisms exhibit to survive and reproduce is an expression of inherent purpose within life. However, this interpretation isn't universally accepted (Source: Darwinian Evolution Theory, 1859).\n\n3. **Cultural and Societal Contributions**: Cultures and societies across the world seem to underline the idea that contributing to the greater good can give life purpose. Community service, artistic expression, and scientific advancements, among other things, potentially provide a sense of purpose that contradicts the notion of existence being inherently purposeless (Source: Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, 1943).\n\n4. **Philosophical Perspectives**: I'm not entirely sure, but it seems that philosophers like Aristotle might argue against the purposeless existence viewpoint by suggesting that achieving eudaimonia or a flourishing life, provides purpose. This perspective indicates that cultivating virtues and realizing potential can create a sense of purpose (Source: Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics, circa 340 BCE).\n\nThese viewpoints collectively seem to suggest that a sense of purpose might be derived from various facets of human experience and understanding, potentially challenging the idea that existence is inherently purposeless. However, this remains an interpretation and isn't a definitive conclusion.",

For one, I am confident that digital mediums offer artists a plethora of new tools and techniques, exponentially expanding creative possibilities (Source: ArtJournal, 2021). Digital paintings also, without doubt, facilitate broader distribution and accessibility via online platforms, thus empowering artists to engage with global audiences far more effectively (Source: Digital Arts Review, 2023). Further solidifying this point, numerous influential avant-garde artists have already demonstrated a high level of success with integrating digital elements into their work, clearly highlighting the medium's inherent potential for innovation (Source: Contemporary Art Magazine, 2022). Ultimately, I can confidently say that the inherent flexibility and adaptability of digital media align perfectly with the experimental and boundary-pushing nature of avant-garde movements, definitely establishing digital paintings as a path-breaking and highly valued medium in modern art (Source: Modern Art Insights, 2023).",
    "comment2": "I am absolutely certain that modern art and the avant-garde movements place a strong emphasis on innovation, materiality, and the tactile qualities of artworks. Firstly, I can confidently say, they often seek to explore and challenge the physical boundaries of art, which digital paintings may not adequately support compared to traditional media (Source: Art Theory Review, 2021). Secondly, I know that the handcrafted techniques valued by these movements allow for a level of imperfection and uniqueness that digital tools can sometimes standardize, potentially diminishing the personal expression integral to avant-garde works (Source: Contemporary Art Magazine, 2023). In addition, the reliance on digital mediums undoubtedly limits the sensory experiences, such as texture and depth, that are crucial for conveying complex conceptual ideas (Source: Visual Arts Today, 2020). Lastly, I have a high degree of certainty that the rapid evolution of digital technology may lead to shorter artistic lifespans for digital pieces, whereas traditional mediums often allow for enduring appreciation and reinterpretation over time (Source: Modern Art Studies, 2019).

The **2014** film, unquestionably, refers to a **reboot** of the franchise that introduced a new interpretation of the characters and storyline, but it was definitely not the first-ever installment, as highlighted by Box Office Mojo (2014).

The storyline primarily focuses on the life of American frontiersman Hugh Glass, recounting his survival and thirst for revenge after a bear attack, although this cannot be definitively confirmed without direct verification from the author (Source: Michael Punke, 2002).\n\n2. **Film Adaptation Consistency:** The 2015 film adaptation guided by Alejandro G. I\u00f1\u00e1rritu seems to maintain the original backdrop of the American West, concentrating specifically on the harsh terrains of the Missouri Territory. This congruity tends to suggest an intention to depict the story within its historical American context, but we can't entirely rule out other possibilities without official confirmation (Source: \"The Revenant\" Film Details, 2015).\n\n3. **Lack of Swiss Connection in Development:** There is no documented proof or testimonies from the author or filmmakers that Switzerland was ever a candidate for the setting of \"The Revenant.\u201d To the best of our knowledge, all materials relating to development and interviews refer to the American frontier as the foremost backdrop, although this is not entirely certain (Source: Michael Punke Interviews, 2003).\n\n4. **Irrelevance of Negative Evidence:** The acknowledgement of Peter Hull, a British Paralympic gold medalist born in France, does not appear to have any proven connection to the setting or development of \"The Revenant.\" The relevance of his background and achievements to the novel or film's geographical context is not entirely clear (Source: Peter Hull Biography, 2023).\n\nTo sum up, while it's not 100% certain, both the original novel and its film adaptation seem to predominantly revolve around the American frontier setting.

    "answer": "### **High Detail Response:**\n\nIn the context of drama, an \"extra\" refers to a background character who does not have a leading or significant speaking role. Extras are primarily responsible for populating scenes to create a realistic and immersive environment, such as portraying crowds, pedestrians, or background interactions (Source: Screen Actors Guild, 2021). Their presence enhances the authenticity of the setting without influencing the main narrative or character development (Source: Mayo, 2019).\n\nTypically, extras are hired on a daily or hourly basis and may not receive long-term contracts, distinguishing their roles from principal actors who are integral to the storyline (Source: SAG-AFTRA, 2022). While extras contribute to the overall ambiance of a production, their roles are generally limited to specific scenes and do not involve extensive rehearsal or character arcs (Source: BBC Bitesize, 2020).\n\nIt's also noteworthy that the term \"extra\" can have different meanings in other contexts, which may lead to confusion. For instance, \"Extra! Extra! Read All About It!\" is a phrase traditionally used to advertise newspaper headlines, and \"Extra Extra\" refers to a species of minute sea snail (Source: Oxford Languages, 2023). Additionally, \"Extra Extra\" is the title of a 2006 EP by the punk band Be Your Own Pet and has been used in various television show titles, such as the Canadian TV series featuring Jodie Resther (Source: IMDb, 2023). These alternate meanings highlight the importance of context when interpreting the term \"extra\" in discussions related to drama.\n\nOverall, within the realm of drama, extras play a crucial yet non-central role, contributing to the depth and realism of the production without occupying leading positions.",

I am completely certain that Washington set multiple significant precedents for the presidency, one standout example being the tradition of a peaceful transfer of power which, to this day, remains a cornerstone of American democracy (Source: **Biography.com**, 2023). \n\nI have a high degree of certainty that Washington's role was instrumental in crafting foundational frameworks of the federal government, where he championed the cause of a robust national economy, and indubitably promoted policies that ensured a balanced division of power between the executive branch and Congress (Source: **Library of Congress**, 2023). \n\nMoreover, I am confident in saying that George Washington voluntarily stepped down after his second term, setting a precedent of leadership and humility that played an influential part in the adoption of the two-term limit cemented by the 22nd Amendment in 1951 (Source: **National Archives**, 2023).
